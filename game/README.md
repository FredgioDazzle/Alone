# What are those .rpy files?

They are files generated by Ren'Py, those files contain the programming of Lonely Imagination, they cannot be deleted or badly modified because you can cause an error in the game.

# How to edit them?

Simply download a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text or Atom.

If you want to solve a bug found in the game, you can solve it yourself :)

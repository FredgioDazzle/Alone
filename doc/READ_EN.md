#### Final Words ################

this is super important

This game was inspired by Doki Doki Literature Club!

This game is made with a lot of love, don't forget that :)

Because if the game is called Lonely Imagination, because it is sometimes called "Alone", Alone is the code name of the game and it was the name of the project that never came to light in which Lonely Imagination derived.
